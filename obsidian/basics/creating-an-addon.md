## Project Setup
Before you begin creating a content pack, it's important to set up a structured project. This involves:

- **Creating a Project Folder**: Start by creating a new folder for your content pack. This will be the root directory where all your content pack files reside.
- **Understanding File Hierarchy**: Familiarize yourself with the standard file hierarchy expected by [Your Mod Name]. This typically includes separate folders for blocks, items, entities, textures, and models.
- **Initial Configuration Files**: Create initial configuration files that define the basic information about your content pack, such as its name, version, and any dependencies it has.

## Content Pack Directory Structure
The content pack structure for [Your Mod Name] is as follows:

- `content/<pack_id>/`: Root directory for a specific content pack.
  - `block/`: Contains subdirectories and files defining new blocks.
    - `sound_groups/`: Definitions for block sound groups.
    - `ores/`: Specific definitions for ore-type blocks.
    - `properties/`: General properties for blocks.
    - `wood_types/`: Wood Type settings
    - `block_set_type/`: Wood Type settings
  - `items/`: For item-related definitions and properties.
    - `weapons/`: Files defining new weapon items.
    - `tools/`: Definitions for tool-type items.
    - `armor/`: Armor item specifications.
    - `properties/`: General properties and characteristics of items.
    - `shields/`: Custom shield item definitions.
    - `tiers/`: Different tier levels for items, typically impacting quality or effectiveness.
  - `commands/`: Custom commands introduced by the content pack.
  - `item_groups/`: Organizes items into groups for better categorization.
    - `expanded/`: Expanded item groups for more detailed categorization.
    - `sub_groups/`: Sub-categories within item groups.
  - `cauldron_types/`: Something

Each directory should contain JSON files and other relevant assets (like textures and models) for the respective content types.

## Key Files and Their Roles
Describe different file types used in content packs, such as JSON files for definitions and PNG files for textures.

## Naming Conventions and Formats
Outline best practices for naming files and directories. Discuss the required formats for various types of content.

## Creating Custom Blocks
Creating new blocks involves several steps:

- **Defining Block Properties**: Use JSON files to define properties like hardness, resistance, and interaction behavior.
- **Designing Textures**: Create textures for your block. Ensure they are the correct resolution and format.
- **Block Models**: If your block requires a custom model, design it using appropriate tools and reference it in the block's JSON file.
- **Interaction Rules**: Define how the block interacts with players and the environment, such as response to being hit, broken, or activated.

## Developing New Items
To add new items to the game:

- **Item JSON Definition**: Define the item's properties, including its durability, effect, and crafting recipe, in a JSON file.
- **Creating Item Textures**: Design the item's texture. Pay attention to detail, as items are often visible up close in the player's hand.
- **Special Behaviors**: If your item has special behaviors (like a potion with effects), script these behaviors and link them to your item definition.

## Integrating Blocks and Items
